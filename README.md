🛠️ Installation & Setup

Install Python 3

Install dependencies:

pip install flask


Run the application:

python app.py


Open the browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

📘 How It Works

The app follows the standard formal steps used in CNF conversion:

Remove nullable productions

Remove unit productions

Reduce rules to binary form

Replace terminals in complex rules

These steps are based on the standard CNF definitions from reputable sources:

CNF Grammar Reference (GeeksforGeeks): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/chomsky-normal-form

Formal Language Theory (TutorialsPoint): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/automata_theory/chomsky_normal_form.htm

Flask Framework Official Documentation: https://flask.palletsprojects.com

Each step is displayed neatly inside a modern card-style box.
